# Horde Bounty Switch

### At what level should we switch bounties in order to maximize credits for a given run of 1-50 ?

This table was created to supplement and refine the data presented by [BChaps](https://gearsofwar.com/en-us/players/bchaps) in his [Chaps Math](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgFP3wqGQNR-ZDlcfVs0RjSvrkqigPy6) video series on the [GoW Tac-Com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxzFwwwU9Y3wm3FKzR8moyQ) Youtube channel.

Given the current ReUp and Horde difficulty, at which level should we switch from using a `Survival I` credits bounty to a `Survival II` XP bounty?
